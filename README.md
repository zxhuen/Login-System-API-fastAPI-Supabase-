# Backend Authentication API Roadmap

This project is part of my backend development journey. The goal is to build a production-ready authentication API by implementing features incrementally while understanding the purpose behind each one.

---

# 🎯 Goal

Build a reusable authentication backend template featuring:

- User Registration
- Password Hashing
- Login
- JWT Authentication
- Protected Routes
- Refresh Tokens
- Authorization
- Search & Pagination
- Clean Architecture
- Production-ready Project Structure

> **Learning Philosophy**
>
> The objective is not only to build a working authentication system but to understand why each feature exists, how it improves security, and how it helps frontend developers integrate with the API efficiently.
